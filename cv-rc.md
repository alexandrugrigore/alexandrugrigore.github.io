<!-- ## Profile -->
I’m a full-stack developer, **Scala/Java** and **TypeScript**-leaning who codes with a typed **OOP/FP** mindset. I care about clarity, modularization/reusability, determinism, and agile development.

I’m building **music-related products** under Aperture Software: 
- **Amplify Music** (music theory insights, deterministic collaborative playlists)
- **SoulKey**: **music puzzle-platformer game** split into a Unity/C# game module **and** a Scala MIDI core designed to double as a standalone learning tool for musicians
- **MIDI** control software, **rhythm-game** prototypes, **instrument-organization** tools

### **Full Stack Developer · Aperture Software · self-owned** <span class="role-dates">2025.May - present (0y5+)</span>
  **Amplify Music ([http://amplify-music.com](http://amplify-music.com/))** - building a product that shows **music-theory** and audio features for the currently playing song, and creates collaborative, deterministic and controllable playlists for multiple users. 
    
  Integrates with Spotify and other streaming services; **for DJs**, provides an event dashboard to create a “party” with mood/filters (allowed/blocked genres, decade, favorite artists/tracks), invite via link/QR, and combine guest preferences into playlists in real time or for advance planning (e.g., weddings), **completely deterministic and transparent**
  
  - **Roles**: product owner, product & tech lead, architecture, end-to-end development, third-party integrations, UX flows, release management.
  - **Tech**: Java 17, Scala 2.13, React Native, Typescript, Docker, Heroku

### **Backend Developer · Berrystack** <span class="role-dates">2024.January - 2025.April (1y4)</span>
  **Energy client** — led migration of data-processing workloads from Microsoft Synapse to Databricks to **cut costs and runtimes**; 
  
  **Designed and delivered a framework** to standardize Spark job authoring/optimization and engineering practices. 
  
  Acted as technical lead across framework implementation, performance tuning, coding standards, and knowledge transfer; wrote **Python in a Java/Scala style** (typed with type hints/mypy, OOP-first with FP patterns like pure functions/immutability/lambdas, explicit interfaces/contracts; **avoided** dynamic/duck-typing idioms).
  - **Tech**: Spark (incl. SQL), Databricks; Python (typed; Java/Scala approach); Azure

</div>

<div class="cv-slab print-avoid-split" markdown="1">

### **Full Stack Developer · Visual Hive** <span class="role-dates">2023.November – 2023.December (0y2)</span>
  **Visual Hive** — built an app to generate social media short clips from long videos (e.g., **podcasts**).
  
  **User flow:** upload -> Deepgram speech-to-text -> transcript with phrase selection -> export clips with subtitles in preset formats. 

  Owned end-to-end POC, API integrations (Deepgram), data modeling (Firebase), payments/subscriptions (Stripe), and UX for the clip-selection flow; wrote Python in a strongly-typed Java/Scala style (type hints/mypy, OOP with FP discipline).
  - **Tech**: Vue, Nuxt, Typescript; Python (typed), Azure Cloud, Firebase, Stripe, Deepgram

</div>

<div class="cv-slab print-avoid-split" markdown="1">

### **Scala Developer · GoPro** <span class="role-dates">2021.September – 2023.March (1y6)</span>
  **GoPro backend** - built and maintained data pipelines (with more advanced SQL than prior roles). Worked across Databricks, Docker, AWS, and Airflow. 
  
  - Notable **pipelines** consumed Google Analytics to track cart abandonment and broader website engagement metrics. In **Scala**, implemented an end-to-end integration with the PagerDuty API that made escalation-policy changes safer and auditable: one repo per service and mandatory PR approval for any policy change.
  - **Tech**: Scala; Spark; Databricks; Docker; AWS Cloud; Airflow; SQL; Git; PagerDuty API.

<div class="cv-slab print-avoid-split" markdown="1">

### **Scala/Java Developer · Orange Services** <span class="role-dates">2017.November – 2021.September (3y11)</span>
  **Telecom big-data platform** — implemented and evolved large-scale data ingestions using a newly built in-house framework, starting from raw mobile network events (2G/3G/4G/LTE) and growing to diverse sources/sinks and well-defined marketing/ML use cases.

  - **Roles:** Framework major improvements; Spark implementation; resource management (YARN + Spark configs); pipeline definitions; scripting; platform configuration (Cloudera); Impala (AP) SQL for analysts during data discovery.
  - **Contributions:** Made sources/sinks **declarative** so teams implement only transformations + QA validation; standardized HDFS, Kafka, FTP/SFTP, Kudu (indexed NoSQL), JDBC; handled **non-standard I/O formats** requiring pre/post-processing (beyond **spark.load**); additional **cluster configuration**, automation, and cleanup scripting.
  - **Notable transformations:** **On-the-fly binary parsing** where decoding depended on previously read values (stateful parsing).
  - **Rapid-response (COVID-19):** Delivered a **mobility/distancing analytics** use case (**GDPR-compliant**, hashing + limited encryption) in **5 days** (2 dev, 3 deploy/test/validate) with a two-engineer core team (plus partner teams); shipped subsequent similar use cases using the same framework speedups.
  - **Framework upgrade:** Unified **streaming vs batch** via a single **config flag** so the **same application/middle layer** code path works for both, simplifying ops and reducing duplication.
  - **Tech**: Scala; Apache Spark; YARN, HDFS; Kafka; Impala (SQL); Kudu; SFTP/FTP, JDBC; Cloudera; bash/scripting.
