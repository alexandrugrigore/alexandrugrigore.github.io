## Profile
I’m a **Scala/Java**-leaning full-stack engineer who codes with a typed OOP/FP mindset. I care about clarity, determinism, and developer ergonomics.

I’m building **music-related products** under **Aperture Software**: **Amplify Music** (React Native + JVM), **MIDI control software**, **rhythm-game prototypes**, **instrument-organization tools**, and game development with **SoulKey**, a music puzzle-platformer split into a **Unity/C# game module** and a **Scala MIDI core** designed to double as a standalone learning tool for musicians.

**Target roles**: Scala/Java backend, Full Stack (Vue/Nuxt, React Native), architecture track.

## Detailed Experience

### **Full Stack Developer - Aperture Software - self-owned <span style="float:right;">2025.May - present (5+ mos)</span>** 
  Amplify Music ([http://amplify-music.com](http://amplify-music.com/))
    - building a product that shows music-theory and audio features for the currently playing song, and creates collaborative, deterministic and controllable playlists for multiple users. 
    
  Integrates with Spotify and other streaming services; for DJs, provides an event dashboard to create a “party” with mood/filters (allowed/blocked genres, decade, favorite artists/tracks), invite via link/QR, and combine guest preferences into playlists in real time or for advance planning (e.g., weddings). 
  
  **Roles**: product & tech lead, architecture, end-to-end development, third-party integrations, UX flows, release management.
- **Tech:** Java 17, Scala 2.13, React Native, Typescript, Docker, Heroku

### **Backend Developer - Aperture Software - Berrystack <span style="float:right;">2024.January - 2025.April (1 yr 4 mos)</span>**
  Energy client — led migration of data-processing workloads from Microsoft Synapse to Databricks to cut costs and runtimes; 
  
  designed and delivered a framework to standardize Spark job authoring/optimization and engineering practices. 
  
  Acted as technical lead across framework implementation, performance tuning, coding standards, and knowledge transfer; wrote Python in a Java/Scala style (typed with type hints/mypy, OOP-first with FP patterns like pure functions/immutability/lambdas, explicit interfaces/contracts; avoided dynamic/duck-typing idioms).
- **Tech:** Spark (incl. SQL), Databricks; Python (typed; Java/Scala approach); Azure

### **Full Stack Developer - Aperture Software - Berrystack <span style="float:right;">2023.November – 2023.December (2 mos)</span>**
  Visual Hive — built an app to generate social short clips from long videos (e.g., podcasts): upload -> Deepgram speech-to-text -> transcript with phrase selection -> export clips with subtitles in preset formats. 

  Owned end-to-end POC, API integrations (Deepgram), data modeling (Firebase), payments/subscriptions (Stripe), and UX for the clip-selection flow; wrote Python in a strongly-typed Java/Scala style (type hints/mypy, OOP with FP discipline).
- **Tech:** Vue, Nuxt, Typescript; Python (typed), Azure, Firebase, Stripe, Deepgram

### **Full Stack Developer - Aperture Software - Brainlight <span style="float:right;">2023.March – 2023.October (8 mos)</span>**
  Revobet - multi-tenant betting platform — full-stack work across users/authorization, SaaS integrations, new features, services integration, and bug-fixing on both backend and frontend. 
  
  Operated in a highly agile/XP environment with focus on effective practices and structured learning, formalizing clean code principles I applied daily
  
  Handled onboarding/training for newcomers.
- **Tech:** Java17, Vue, Nuxt, Typescript, Kafka; Spring Framework; reactive streaming; JUnit5, Mockito, property-based testing, Vavr, Lombok, MapStruct; functional paradigm; Material Design; Trunk-Based Development, XP, refactoring, MVP; Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, CI/CD (GoCD)

### **Scala Developer - GoPro <span style="float:right;">2021.September – 2023.March (1 yr 6 mos)</span>**
  Built and maintained **data pipelines** (with **more advanced SQL** than prior roles). Worked across **Databricks**, **Docker**, **AWS**, and **Airflow**. Notable pipelines consumed **Google Analytics** to track **cart abandonment** and broader website engagement metrics. In Scala, implemented an **end-to-end integration with the PagerDuty API** that made **escalation-policy changes** safer and auditable: **one repo per service** and **mandatory PR approval** for any policy change.
- **Tech:** **Scala**; **Spark**; **Databricks**; **Docker**; **AWS**; **Airflow**; **SQL**; Git; **PagerDuty API**.

### **Scala/Java Developer - Orange Services <span style="float:right;">2017.November – 2021.September (3 yr 11 mos)</span>**
  Hired for my Scala/Java background and learned Spark/big-data on the job. Started by implementing data ingestions with a newly built (still evolving) in-house framework, pulling **raw mobile network events (2G/3G/4G/LTE)** from providers (actual device events, not synthetic analytics feeds). Early pipelines used **SFTP → Parquet on HDFS**; I focused on **Spark implementation**, **resource management** (**YARN + Spark configs**), **pipeline definitions**, scripting, **platform configuration** (Cloudera), and writing **Impala (AP) SQL** for analysts during data discovery.  
  As the program grew, ingestions multiplied (new sources/sinks; clear marketing/ML use cases). I contributed heavily to the framework so **sources/sinks became declarative**, letting teams implement only the middle layer (**transformations + QA validation**) per use case. Implemented/standardized **HDFS, Kafka, FTP/SFTP, Kudu (indexed NoSQL), JDBC** and more. Dealt with **non-standard input/output formats** requiring pre/post-processing (beyond simple `spark.load`).  
  Additional contributions included **cluster configuration**, automation, and cleanup scripting.  
  **Notable transformations:** on-the-fly **binary parsing** where decoding depended on previously read values (stateful parsing).  
  **Rapid-response project (COVID-19):** delivered a **mobility/distancing analytics** use case (**GDPR-compliant**, hashing + limited encryption) in **5 days** (2 days dev, 3 days deploy/test/validate) with a two-engineer core team (plus partner teams); subsequent similar use cases were shipped with the same framework speedups.  
  **Framework upgrade:** unified **streaming vs batch** via a single **config flag**; same application/middle layer code path for both, simplifying ops and reducing duplication.
- **Tech:** **Scala**; **Apache Spark**; **YARN**, **HDFS**; **Kafka**; **Impala (SQL)**; **Kudu**; **SFTP/FTP**, **JDBC**; **Cloudera**; bash/scripting.


### **Java Developer - Luxoft Romania <span style="float:right;">2015.November – 2017.November (2 yr 1 mos)</span>**
- **Summary:** 
  **HTML5 Web Interface for Hirschmann devices (4 months)** — rewrote the legacy **Java Applet** web UI for industrial routers/switches to **HTML5**, implementing pages with an internal framework and contributing improvements back to it.  
  **Industrial HiVision (1 year 8 months)** — moved to the network management desktop app (topology configuration, monitoring, simplified device configuration). Delivered my first **major-release feature** end-to-end: a **network events map** (design + implementation). First formal **Agile/Scrum** experience. Introduced Scala to the team by implementing a **Scala-based integration test automation tool**.
- **Tech:** **Java**; **HTML5/CSS/JS**; **SNMP**; internal UI framework; testing & **automation** (Scala for integration tests); network lab tooling; version control (Git), CI basics.

### **Scala Developer - Brainlight <span style="float:right;">2014.July – 2015.September (1 yr 3 mos)</span>**
- **Summary:** DarZar — product crawler/scraper/extractor/aggregation/search across e-shops, enabling search/filtering and price-change alerts ([http://darzar.com](http://darzar.com/)). Worked full-stack across website UI, database management, and non-UI algorithms.
- **Tech:** Scala; full-stack web; crawling/aggregation/search
