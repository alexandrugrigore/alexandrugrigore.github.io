## Objectives

My objective is mastering functional programming in Scala, and as a long-term goal, becoming a software architect.

I’m always looking for a challenge, open to new technologies, tools, development styles, new project types and I become passionate very quickly. 

## Experience:

- **Software Development Engineer, Orange Services, 2017.November – present** 
    - **Project description:** I am currently working on various projects involving Big Data, using Scala,  
    in some particular cases Java, and Spark for development.  
    Other non-development tools I use include SQL (Hive, Impala), Kafka, YARN, HDFS, Hue, bash and Cloudera as a management tool.
    - **Roles:** development, design, refactoring, devops
    - **Roles description:** I am mainly a developer for various bigdata projects, but a lot of my work also involves SQL (mainly not relational),
    devops/scripting for some tasks that can be easily automated, managing/configuring the cluster (in Cloudera or direcly on the machine). 

- **Java Developer, Luxoft Romania, 2015.November – 2017.November** 
    - **Industrial HiVision (until end)** 
        - **Project description:** Desktop application for configuring/managing the network and the devices in the network 
        - **Roles:** development, integrator, refactoring, bugfixing, testing, automated testing
        - **Roles description:** I am a front-end and back-end developer for this application, making new features, bugfixing, testing,  
        automated testing and creating documentation. I also create new tools that help the whole team, like helpers for testing.
        - **Training role:** I helped new colleagues get acquainted with the application, the building process, the development process,  
        SCRUM methodology, and other points that helped them get started.

    - **HTML5 Web Interface for Hirschmann devices (4 months)** 
        - **Project description:** Replace the old Java applet-based web interface with HTML5 
        - **Roles:** development, integrator, refactoring 
        - **Roles description:** I was a front-end developer, creating the website UI, using SNMP to retrieve data, making validations  
        and using thread-safe methods to allow multiple users configure devices, and also helped in the creation of the framework used. 
        - **Training role:** I helped other newly assigned team members to the project, to setup the environment,  
        how the task assignment works, explain the framework, and explain the best practices. 

- **Scala Developer, Brainlight, 2014.July – 2015.September** 
    - **DarZar** – crawler, scrapper, extractor, advertising, aggregation, search 
    - **Project description:** Darzar indexes products from any existing e-shop and lets the user search,   
    filter and know when a price changes. ([http://darzar.com](http://darzar.com/)) 
    - **Roles:** design, development, integrator 
    - **Roles description:** I was a front-end and back-end developer at Darzar. I developed in every area of the project,  
    from the website UI, to the database management and the algorithms that are not directly correlated to the website. 
    - **Achievements:** I have reduced the site's bounce rate by 50-60%.

## Personal Projects:

- **SoulKey game**
    - I am currently developing a music related puzzle-platformer game. The development is done as two separate projects/modules.
    - One is the game itself, developed in Unity/C#, plus all the related work that must be put in a game  
    (assets, story, art, music, game mechanics, monetization ideas just to name a few).
    - The other module is the core of the game, which for now is developed in Scala, and uses midi input for various functions in the game.  
    functional programming, development, TDD, BDD, refactoring, pair programming, programming language paradigms, responsive design.   
    This, when done, can also be released separately as a learning tool for begginer (and in the future advanced) musicians.

- **Various projects in high-school, university and after** 
    - This section is for highlighting my passion for programming throught the years, even if the tech was not frutified in jobs
    - minigame in Scala-JS, mobile apps in Xamarin/Android/iOS, windows app in Visual Fox Pro + MS Access, a lot of sites in HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Education:

- **University of Bucharest, Computer Sciences, Informatics, not finished** (2013 – 2015) 

Even though I did not finish college, my 2 years of studying were very useful, and helped me to better understand what I want,

I have no problem in talking more about this aspect in person.
