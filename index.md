## Objectives

My objective is mastering functional programming, and as a long-term goal, becoming a software architect.

## Personal Projects:

- **SoulKey game**
    - I am currently developing a music related puzzle-platformer game. The development is done as two separate projects/modules.
    - One is the game itself, developed in Unity/C#, plus all the related work that must be put in a game  
    (assets, story, art, music, game mechanics, monetization ideas just to name a few).
    - The other module is the core of the game, which for now is developed in Scala, and uses MIDI input for various functions in the game.  
    This, when done, can also be released separately as a learning tool for beginner (and in the future advanced) musicians.

- **Various projects in high-school, university and after** 
    - This section is for highlighting my passion for programming throughout the years, even if the tech was not used in jobs
    - mini-game in Scala-JS, mobile apps in Xamarin/Android/iOS, Windows app in Visual Fox Pro + MS Access, a lot of sites in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
