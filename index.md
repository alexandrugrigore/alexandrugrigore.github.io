## Objectives

My objective is mastering functional programming in Scala, and as a long-term goal, becoming a software architect.

I’m always looking for a challenge, open to new technologies, tools, development styles, new industries and project types. 

## Experience:

- **Data Engineer, GoPro, 2021.September – present**
  - **Project description:** I am currently working on various projects involving Big Data, using Scala,  
    in some particular cases Java, and Spark for development.  
    Other non-development tools I use include SQL (Spark), Databricks, Docker, AWS, Airflow.
  - **Roles:** development, design, refactoring, data pipelines
    - **Roles description:** I am mainly a data pipeline developer/designer for various bigdata use cases. 
    I sometimes also work on infrastructure projects (implementing APIs that are used internally)

- **Software Development Engineer, Orange Services, 2017.November – 2021.September** 
    - **Project description:** I am currently working on various projects involving Big Data, using Scala,  
    in some particular cases Java, and Spark for development.  
    Other non-development tools I use include SQL (Spark, Hive, Impala), Kafka, YARN, HDFS, Hue, bash and Cloudera as a management tool.
    - **Roles:** development, design, refactoring, devops
    - **Roles description:** I am mainly a developer for various bigdata projects, but a lot of my work also involves SQL (mainly not relational),
    devops/scripting for some tasks that can be easily automated, managing/configuring the cluster (in Cloudera or directly on the machine). 

- **Java Developer, Luxoft Romania, 2015.November – 2017.November** 
    - **Industrial HiVision (until end)** 
        - **Project description:** Desktop application for configuring/managing the network and the devices in the network 
        - **Roles:** development, integrator, refactoring, bug fixing, testing, automated testing
        - **Roles description:** I was a front-end and back-end developer for this application, making new features, bugfixing, testing,  
        automated testing and creating documentation. I also created new tools that help the whole team, like helpers for testing.
        - **Training role:** I helped new colleagues get acquainted with the application, the building process, the development process,  
        SCRUM methodology, and other points that helped them get started.

    - **HTML5 Web Interface for Hirschmann devices (4 months)** 
        - **Project description:** Replace the old Java applet-based web interface with HTML5 
        - **Roles:** development, integrator, refactoring 
        - **Roles description:** I was a front-end developer, creating the website UI, using SNMP to retrieve data, making validations  
        and using thread-safe methods to allow multiple users configure devices, and also helped in the creation of the framework used. 
        - **Training role:** I helped other newly assigned team members to the project, to set up the environment,  
        how the task assignment works, explain the framework, and explain the best practices. 

- **Scala Developer, Brainlight, 2014.July – 2015.September** 
    - **DarZar** – crawler, scrapper, extractor, advertising, aggregation, search 
    - **Project description:** Darzar indexes products from any existing e-shop and lets the user search,   
    filter and know when a price changes. ([http://darzar.com](http://darzar.com/)) 
    - **Roles:** design, development, integrator 
    - **Roles description:** I was a front-end and back-end developer at Darzar. I developed in every area of the project,  
    from the website UI, to the database management and the algorithms that are not directly related to the website. 
    - **Achievements:** I have reduced the site's bounce rate by 50-60%.

## Personal Projects:

- **AmplifyMusic**
  - Developing a music playlist manager app that creates a 'party' playlist based on configurable settings (ex. mood) 
  and a selected playlist as a seed. Others can join using their own playlist. If you cannot use the app, contact me for a demo.

- **SoulKey game**
    - I am currently developing a music related puzzle-platformer game. The development is done as two separate projects/modules.
    - One is the game itself, developed in Unity/C#, plus all the related work that must be put in a game  
    (assets, story, art, music, game mechanics, monetization ideas just to name a few).
    - The other module is the core of the game, which for now is developed in Scala, and uses MIDI input for various functions in the game.  
    This, when done, can also be released separately as a learning tool for beginner (and in the future advanced) musicians.

- **Various projects in high-school, university and after** 
    - This section is for highlighting my passion for programming throughout the years, even if the tech was not used in jobs
    - mini-game in Scala-JS, mobile apps in Xamarin/Android/iOS, Windows app in Visual Fox Pro + MS Access, a lot of sites in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
