## Objectives

My objective is mastering functional programming in Scala, and as a long-term goal, becoming a software architect.

I’m always looking for a challenge, open to new technologies, tools, development styles, new industries and project types. 

## Experience:

## Personal Projects:

- **AmplifyMusic**
  - Developing a music playlist manager app that integrates with Spotify or any other music streaming service.

- **SoulKey game**
    - I am currently developing a music related puzzle-platformer game. The development is done as two separate projects/modules.

    - The other module is the core of the game, which for now is developed in Scala, and uses MIDI input for various functions in the game.  
    This, when done, can also be released separately as a learning tool for beginner (and in the future advanced) musicians.

- **Various projects in high-school, university and after** 
    - This section is for highlighting my passion for programming throughout the years, even if the tech was not used in jobs
